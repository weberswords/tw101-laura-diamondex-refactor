// Exercise #8: Create a new version of Exercise #7 where you also record all of the userâ€™s guesses and print them out
// once they guess correctly. Use an ArrayList to store the guesses. Catch the NumberFormatException and handle the case
// where the user entered a String that is not parseable.

/*
Because I use the Scanner class to read the input, and nextInt() as the method, the scanner expects the user to
enter an integer. If the user enters input other than an integer, the scanner throws an InputMismatchException.
Therefore, a NumberFormatException will not be thrown unless the scanner allows a 'misread' (i.e. accepting
unexpected input). For this reason I catch a InputMismatchException instead.
